    console.log(`Deep into that darkness peeringLong I stood there, wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals

Ever dared to dream before;

But the silence was unbroken,

And the stillness gave no token,

And the only word there spoken

Was the whispered word, 

This I whispered, and an echo

Murmured back the word, 

Merely this, and nothing more.`)
