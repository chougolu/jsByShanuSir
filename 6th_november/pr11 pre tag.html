  <pre>  Deep into that darkness peering

Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,

Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals

Ever dared to dream before;

But the silence was unbroken,

And the stillness gave no token,

And the only word there spoken

Was the whispered word, 

This I whispered, and an echo

Murmured back the word, 

Merely this, and nothing more.</pre>
